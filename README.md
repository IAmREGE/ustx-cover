# USTX files of cover songs
## How to use
For better syntax highlighting, all extensions of USTX files are changed to
`yml`. You may need to change it to `ustx`.

Most of the lyrics are inserted with
[DiffSinger](https://github.com/openvpi/DiffSinger) phonemizers. You may need
to convert them in order to make them compatible with other SVS software.

The instrumental audios are not included. You may need to adjust the timelines
to align the tracks with them.

## Report issues
Feel free to open an issue if you encounter an error when you load the files,
or if you find something incorrect.

## Licenses
The USTX files are licensed under MIT License unless explicitly specified.

By definitions of “Derivative Works”, all exported audios are not treated as
“derivative works” and do not need to comply with MIT License.
